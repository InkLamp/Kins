# Kins
A list of my kins ->

Comso [DANDY'S WORLD]

Yes, the roll cake. Cosmo is a heavy FICTKIN of this user!! This user does not like feminized/femboy Cosmo NOR do they enjoy fruitcake so fruitcake DNI!! Rarepairs are okay though in my personal opinion. This user HCs Cosmo as a chubby-short male with high levels of strength!! They also main Cosmo on DW :3

Lampert [REGRETEVATOR]

A lamp? This is getting out of hand. Anywho. Lampert is a COMFORTKIN meaning I kin him because he brings me COMFORT not because I relate to him. Lampert is a character I may be in if overwhelmed, stressed, or in need of any genuine strong comfort

Feliciano Vargas/Northern Italy

A country.. this is really just strange now. As a generally chaotic yet loving person, very affectionate and hyperactive ALL of the time, he fits me, and I will probably be seen lounging around in this skin from time to time.
